# unit-4-game

psuedocode

a game with 4 crystals and random result

every crystal needs to have a random number between 1-12

A new random number should be generated ever single time we win or lost to those 4 crystals

when clicking any crystal, it should add the previous result

until it equals the total score

if it is not equal, then we start over

if it is equal, then we increment a win counter
